    <h1>tg_bot_fileid2</h1>
    <p>
        A robot developed by RandCater for obtaining file_id<br>
        Currently, functionality is limited. Future updates will improve functionality and integrate with tdl to store restricted content. Once functionality is complete, it will be rewritten in C++ to improve efficiency.<br>
        Additionally, due to my extreme laziness, updates may occur on some random date in the future. (Did I also write a home sensor? That seems like a Jurassic-era project now.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        由randcarter开发的用于使用TGurl获取file_ID的自动机<br>
        目前功能有限 后续将完善功能与tdl合用以保存受限制内容 功能完整后将使用cpp重写以提高效率<br>
        另外本人懒惰至极更新可能在某年13月32日更新<br>
